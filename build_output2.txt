ÔÜá Warning: Next.js inferred your workspace root, but it may not be correct.
 We detected multiple lockfiles and selected the directory of C:\Users\robso\.gemini\antigravity\scratch\package-lock.json as the root directory.
 To silence this warning, set `turbopack.root` in your Next.js config, or consider removing one of the lockfiles if it's not needed.
   See https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/config/next-config-js/turbopack#root-directory for more information.
 Detected additional lockfiles: 
   * C:\Users\robso\.gemini\antigravity\scratch\aps-nurse-saas\package-lock.json

You're importing a component that needs `useEffect`. This React Hook only works in a Client Component. To fix, mark the file (or its parent) with the `"use client"` directive.
